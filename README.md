# quickstart-mactores-eldorado

This Quick Start is for users who manage IBM LSF Clusters and want to optimize and predict the cluster resources and license consumption of jobs on LSF Cluster.

Many companies face the problem of using a large portion of their budget on licenses and hardware from inefficient resource allocation, and opportunity cost from loss of productivity.  Using this Quick Start, companies are able to view advanced analytics outcomes with a comprehensive pre-built dashboard. El Dorado makes it simple to view insights for licensing, job type-based views, identify underutilized hardware and misconfiguration, and provides the intelligent queueing for job assignments to optimize cluster and license utilization.
