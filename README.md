## Axomo on the AWS Cloud

This Quick Start automatically deploys Axomo on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud in about 25 minutes. Itâ€™s intended for users who manage IBM Spectrum LSF RTM, which is an operational dashboard for IBM Spectrum LSF environments that monitors, reports on, and manages load sharing facility (LSF) workloads.

Axomo on AWS is available as a cost-effective, secure, AWS serverless architecture that includes AWS Glue, Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), Amazon SageMaker, and Amazon Athena.

Axomo addresses an industry-wide problem for companies that spend much of their budget on licenses and hardware from inefficient resource allocation, and that have an opportunity cost from loss of productivity. 

Via a pre-built dashboard, you can use Axomo on AWS to:

- Optimize, predict, and obtain insights on cluster resources and license consumption of jobs on LSF clusters.
- Identify underused hardware and misconfigurations.
- Scale compute and storage.
- Right-size resources used, such as the ratio of central processing units (CPUs) to random access memory (RAM).

This reference architecture is automated by AWS CloudFormation templates that you can customize to meet your specific requirements. The AWS CloudFormation templates included with the Quick Start automate the following:

- Deploying Axomo into a new virtual private cloud (VPC)
- Deploying Axomo into an existing VPC in your AWS account
